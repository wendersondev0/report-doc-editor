# 📝 Report Doc Editor

An interactive document editor where users can create, edit, and enrich documents with dynamic data elements such as charts, tables, and calculated values — powered by saved queries from a database.

This project aims to simulate a lightweight version of tools like Google Docs or Notion, but with a special focus on **data-driven components** embedded directly into the editable content.

## 🚀 Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to **practice and showcase my full stack development skills**, gradually adding more advanced technologies, design patterns, and software architecture concepts.

---

## 🧠 My Current Tech Stack

I currently specialize in:

- **C#**
- **ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs**
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **Dapper**
- **SQL Server**
- **REST APIs**
- **Git (monorepos and multi-repos)**

---

## 🌱 Learning In Progress

As of now, I’m actively studying and building proficiency in:

- **React.js** (component-based UI)
- **Next.js** (server-side rendering and fullstack capabilities)
- **TypeScript** (typed JavaScript)

This project is my hands-on journey in mastering modern frontend frameworks and fullstack architecture.
